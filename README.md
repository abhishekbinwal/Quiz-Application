This is a responsive, glassmorphic quiz application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Only . It features a glowing neon heading, animated transitions, and a blurred anime-style background for immersive aesthetics.

Users can answer multiple-choice questions, interact with hover effects, and enjoy smooth fade-in animations.

Designed to be mobile-friendly and visually engaging, this project is perfect for learning DOM manipulation, styling techniques, and responsive design fundamentals.

I have focused more on javascript part.
